## 🔥 Why This Project?
Most beginner projects stop at plotting prices. This one goes **several layers deeper**.

This repository mirrors how a **real analyst** approaches equity analysis:
- Market behavior **and** business fundamentals
- Data quality validation **before** insights
- Risk, volatility, and risk‑adjusted performance
- Clear, decision‑oriented storytelling

No tutorials. No shortcuts. Just disciplined analysis.

---

## 🧠 What This Project Answers
- Is stock price movement supported by **revenue growth**?
- How volatile is each stock across market regimes?
- Which company delivers **better risk‑adjusted returns**?
- Are insights derived from **clean, reliable data**?

## Summary of the Project

This project delivers an end-to-end financial data analysis of **Tesla** and **NVIDIA**, integrating market behavior with business fundamentals to generate **risk-aware, decision-oriented insights**.

The analysis combines **API-based stock price extraction**, **real-world web scraping of revenue data**, and **automated data profiling** to validate data quality before conducting any analytical evaluation. Core techniques applied include trend analysis using moving averages, volatility and rolling volatility assessment, normalized performance comparison, and **risk-adjusted return measurement through the Sharpe Ratio**.

The results indicate that **NVIDIA demonstrates stronger risk-adjusted performance**, supported by consistent and accelerating revenue growth, while **Tesla exhibits higher volatility**, reflecting a higher risk–reward profile influenced more heavily by market sentiment and growth expectations.

Overall, this project demonstrates the ability to transform raw financial data into **structured, executive-level insights**, closely aligning with real-world workflows used in **data analytics, business intelligence, and financial analysis roles**.

## 📊 Analytical Coverage
- 📈 Stock price trend analysis
- 📉 50‑day & 200‑day moving averages
- 🔄 Revenue vs stock price comparison
- ⚠️ Volatility & rolling volatility
- 📐 Normalized performance comparison
- 📏 Sharpe Ratio (risk‑adjusted returns)
- 🔍 Automated data profiling (HTML reports)

---

## 🧪 Data Quality Comes First
Before analysis, datasets were validated using **automated profiling** to:
- Detect missing values and anomalies
- Understand distributions and skewness
- Ensure conclusions are statistically sound

This reflects **industry best practices**, not classroom workflows.

---

## 💡 Executive‑Level Insights
- **NVIDIA** demonstrates superior **risk‑adjusted performance**, supported by accelerating revenue growth.
- **Tesla** offers higher upside potential with materially higher volatility.
- Revenue analysis helps distinguish **fundamental growth** from **sentiment‑driven price movement**.

---

## ⚠️ Assumptions & Notes
- Stock data sourced via `yfinance` and assumed exchange‑adjusted.
- Revenue data scraped from Macrotrends and assumed accurate as published.
- Risk‑free rate assumed to be zero for Sharpe ratio comparison.
- Revenue is quarterly; stock prices are daily — comparisons focus on directional alignment.

---

## 🎯 Why This Stands Out
✔ Real‑world scraping challenges handled
✔ Data quality validated before insights
✔ Risk‑aware analysis
✔ Executive‑style communication
✔ Portfolio‑ready structure

This project focuses on **thinking like an analyst**, not just coding.
