# 🚀 Web Scraping & Stock Data Visualization
## Tesla ⚡ | NVIDIA 🧠
### *End‑to‑End Financial Analysis with Executive‑Grade Insights*

---

## 🔥 Why This Project?
Most beginner projects stop at plotting prices. This one goes **several layers deeper**.

This repository mirrors how a **real analyst** approaches equity analysis:
- Market behavior **and** business fundamentals
- Data quality validation **before** insights
- Risk, volatility, and risk‑adjusted performance
- Clear, decision‑oriented storytelling

No tutorials. No shortcuts. Just disciplined analysis.

---

## 🧠 What This Project Answers
- Is stock price movement supported by **revenue growth**?
- How volatile is each stock across market regimes?
- Which company delivers **better risk‑adjusted returns**?
- Are insights derived from **clean, reliable data**?

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Python**
- **yfinance** – market data extraction
- **Requests & BeautifulSoup** – web scraping
- **pandas & numpy** – data processing
- **matplotlib** – analytical visualization
- **ydata‑profiling** – automated data diagnostics
- **Git & GitHub** – version control

## 📊 Analytical Coverage
- 📈 Stock price trend analysis
- 📉 50‑day & 200‑day moving averages
- 🔄 Revenue vs stock price comparison
- ⚠️ Volatility & rolling volatility
- 📐 Normalized performance comparison
- 📏 Sharpe Ratio (risk‑adjusted returns)
- 🔍 Automated data profiling (HTML reports)

---

## 🧪 Data Quality Comes First
Before analysis, datasets were validated using **automated profiling** to:
- Detect missing values and anomalies
- Understand distributions and skewness
- Ensure conclusions are statistically sound

This reflects **industry best practices**, not classroom workflows.

---

## 💡 Executive‑Level Insights
- **NVIDIA** demonstrates superior **risk‑adjusted performance**, supported by accelerating revenue growth.
- **Tesla** offers higher upside potential with materially higher volatility.
- Revenue analysis helps distinguish **fundamental growth** from **sentiment‑driven price movement**.

---

## ⚠️ Assumptions & Notes
- Stock data sourced via `yfinance` and assumed exchange‑adjusted.
- Revenue data scraped from Macrotrends and assumed accurate as published.
- Risk‑free rate assumed to be zero for Sharpe ratio comparison.
- Revenue is quarterly; stock prices are daily — comparisons focus on directional alignment.

---

## 🎯 Why This Stands Out
✔ Real‑world scraping challenges handled
✔ Data quality validated before insights
✔ Risk‑aware analysis
✔ Executive‑style communication
✔ Portfolio‑ready structure

This project focuses on **thinking like an analyst**, not just coding.
